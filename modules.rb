#Modules and classes are different. Modules are about functions while classes are about objects
#Another way to think about modules are libraries

#Creating a module
#Look at modules2.rb
module MyStuff
    def MyStuff.apple()
        puts "I AM APPLES!"
    end

    TANGERINE = "Living reflection of a dream" #Creating a property for MyStuff module
end
